## Project Proposal and Peer Review Process (10% of the Total Grade, Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3 (5% of the Total Grade)
{:.no_toc}

By the end of Week 3, your group will submit a 2-page project proposal that outlines your chosen research topic, any relevant background, and its potential to impact healthcare using AI. Don’t worry if you’re still working out some details—that’s what this stage is for! Your proposal should present a clear research question or problem, along with your planned approach and any initial thoughts on how AI can be applied to address it.

Once the proposals are submitted, they will be anonymized and distributed among your peers for review. Each student will be responsible for reviewing two anonymized proposals. We’ll model this review process after the criteria used for journal article reviews, so you’ll be asked to provide thoughtful, constructive feedback that encourages improvement and deeper exploration. You may suggest additional questions for the group to consider or point them to relevant resources and references to guide their project development.

The feedback process is a crucial part of learning how to think critically about research, both your own and others. Your reviews should focus on supporting your classmates in refining their ideas in a respectful and thoughtful way. The aim here is to create a positive, collaborative environment where we can all learn from one another.

### Week 4 (5% of the Total Grade)
{:.no_toc}

After all reviews are collected, we will anonymize and consolidate the feedback before returning it to your group. You’ll then have the chance to decide how you want to address the feedback in your final proposal submission, due at the end of Week 4. You’re free to implement the suggestions from your peers or proceed with your original plan, but either way, this process is meant to help you think more deeply about your project’s direction.

## Mid-Term Project Presentations (10% of the Total Grade, Week 7)

Midway through the semester, your group will give a midterm project presentation to showcase your progress. This is your chance to share your initial findings, challenges, and next steps, while receiving valuable feedback from your peers and instructors. Presentations will be informal and aimed at helping you progress with your project—so don’t worry if you’re not fully finished yet! We’ll use this session to troubleshoot any difficulties you’re encountering and provide pointers to help guide you through the second half of the project.

## Final Project Presentations and Report (63% of the Total Grade, Week 13)

In the final weeks of the course, you’ll present your completed project in a 10-minute presentation, followed by a 5-minute Q&A session. This is your chance to showcase the research and insights you’ve developed throughout the semester.

Additionally, you’ll submit a written [NeurIPS-style report](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers) detailing your research question, methods, results, and conclusions. We’re setting high standards for this report because we believe in your potential to rise to the challenge. This is a wonderful dress rehearsal for the moment when you’ll need to submit your own research in the future. The report should follow the structure of a formal scientific article, including an abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. There’s no page limit, but we encourage you to be thorough and concise in your exploration and articulation of your findings.

The final presentations and reports are meant to celebrate the hard work you’ve done and prepare you for the professional standards you’ll encounter in your academic career.

## What We Hope You’ll Gain

We hope this project will give you a sense of ownership over your learning and the ability to see firsthand how AI can be applied to important challenges in healthcare. Along the way, you’ll sharpen your research skills, collaborate with peers, and gain valuable experience in both giving and receiving feedback. Most importantly, we want you to feel confident and inspired as you work through the complexities of applying AI to real-world medical problems.

Remember, this project is about learning and growth, so don’t be afraid to explore new ideas, make mistakes, and ask for help when needed. We’re excited to see where your creativity and hard work will take you!
