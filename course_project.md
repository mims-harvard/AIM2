# AI in Medicine II - Course Project 


## Overview

The term project is an exciting opportunity for you to work in small groups (3-5 students, assigned at random) and explore an area of AI that you believe could have a major impact on healthcare. This project is designed to foster creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking while allowing you to apply the AI methodologies and concepts you’re learning in class to a real-world challenge. We hope this will be an engaging and rewarding process as you work together to develop your ideas.
Project Proposal and Peer Review Process 
15% of the total grade. 
Week 3:
By the end of Week 3, your group will submit a 2-page project proposal that outlines your chosen research topic, any relevant background, and its potential to impact healthcare using AI. Don’t worry if you’re still working out some details—that’s what this stage is for! Your proposal should present a clear research question or problem, along with your planned approach and any initial thoughts on how AI can be applied to address it.
Once the proposals are submitted, they will be anonymized and distributed among your peers for review. Each student will be responsible for reviewing two anonymized proposals. We’ll model this review process after the criteria used for journal article reviews, so you’ll be asked to provide thoughtful, constructive feedback that encourages improvement and deeper exploration. You may suggest additional questions for the group to consider or point them to relevant resources and references to guide their project development.
The feedback process is a crucial part of learning how to think critically about research, both your own and others. Your reviews should focus on supporting your classmates in refining their ideas in a respectful and thoughtful way. The aim here is to create a positive, collaborative environment where we can all learn from one another.
Week 4:
After all reviews are collected, we will anonymize and consolidate the feedback before returning it to your group. You’ll then have the chance to decide how you want to address the feedback in your final proposal submission, due at the end of Week 4. You’re free to implement the suggestions from your peers or proceed with your original plan, but either way, this process is meant to help you think more deeply about your project’s direction.
Mid-Term Project Presentations (Week 7)
10% of the total grade. 
Midway through the semester, your group will give a midterm project presentation to showcase your progress. This is your chance to share your initial findings, challenges, and next steps, while receiving valuable feedback from your peers and instructors. Presentations will be informal and aimed at helping you progress with your project—so don’t worry if you’re not fully finished yet! We’ll use this session to troubleshoot any difficulties you’re encountering and provide pointers to help guide you through the second half of the project.
Final Project Presentations and Report (Week 13)
75% of the total grade.
In the final weeks of the course, you’ll present your completed project in a 15-minute presentation, followed by a 5-minute Q&A session. This is your chance to showcase the research and insights you’ve developed throughout the semester.
Additionally, you’ll submit a written report that should resemble a journal article, ready for submission to a high-impact AI in medicine journal. We’re setting high standards for this report because we believe in your potential to rise to the challenge. This is a wonderful dress rehearsal for the moment when you’ll need to submit your own research in the future. The report should follow the structure of a formal scientific article, including an abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. There’s no page limit, but we encourage you to be thorough and concise in your exploration and articulation of your findings.
The final presentations and reports are meant to celebrate the hard work you’ve done and prepare you for the professional standards you’ll encounter in your academic career.

## What We Hope You’ll Gain
We hope this project will give you a sense of ownership over your learning and the ability to see firsthand how AI can be applied to important challenges in healthcare. Along the way, you’ll sharpen your research skills, collaborate with peers, and gain valuable experience in both giving and receiving feedback. Most importantly, we want you to feel confident and inspired as you work through the complexities of applying AI to real-world medical problems.
Remember, this project is about learning and growth, so don’t be afraid to explore new ideas, make mistakes, and ask for help when needed. We’re excited to see where your creativity and hard work will take you!

## Project Milestones

### 1. Project Proposal (Due Week 3, with edits Week 4)

Your project proposal is an essential first step in outlining your research plan and preparing for the term project. It should include:
Hypothesis or Research Question: Clearly define the research question or hypothesis your project will investigate.
Background Research: Summarize relevant studies or literature that supports your project idea and provides context.
Dataset: Identify the dataset(s) you plan to use. Explain how it is suitable for your research question.
Baseline Model: Select a baseline model that will serve as the starting point for comparison (e.g., a commonly used AI model in healthcare).
Proposed Methodology: Outline the techniques or models you plan to implement and describe why they are appropriate for your project.
Resources: List any tools, software, or compute resources you will need to complete your project.
Challenges and Contingency Plans: Describe potential challenges or difficulties you might face (use a softer term like “hurdles” or “areas of uncertainty”) and include a contingency plan to address these.
This proposal will set the foundation for your project and will be reviewed by your peers for feedback.

### 2. Midterm Presentation (Due Week 7)
The midterm presentation is a checkpoint to assess progress and receive feedback. Focus on communicating your problem clearly and presenting your current work. The presentation should include:
Problem Statement and Background: Reiterate the problem you're addressing and its significance in healthcare. Provide a quick summary of your background research.
Methodology: Explain the approach you're using to solve the problem, even if it’s still evolving.
Baseline Results: Share any preliminary results you have from the baseline model, along with initial observations.
Challenges and Proposed Solutions: Outline any hurdles or limitations you’re facing. Provide possible solutions you are considering to address these issues.
Singular Ask for Feedback: Pose one specific question or challenge you want feedback on from the class. This could be related to methodology, data, model choice, etc.
This presentation is an opportunity to gather input and fine-tune your project direction before finalizing your work.

### 3. Final Report and Presentation (Due Week 13)
The final report should be written in the style of a formal NeurIPS conference paper, adhering to high academic standards. It must include:
Introduction: Provide a clear and concise overview of your research question and its importance in healthcare AI.
Background: Summarize the literature and context that support your research.
Methods: Describe in detail the models and techniques you implemented, with explanations of their appropriateness for your problem.
Results: Present the results of your experiments, including figures, tables, and performance metrics.
Discussion: Analyze the implications of your results, including limitations and potential improvements.
Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and suggest next steps for future research.
Your final presentation should be equivalent to a conference presentation. It should include clear visuals, be engaging, and succinctly cover your entire project from start to finish. You’ll have 15 minutes to present, followed by 5 minutes for questions.
