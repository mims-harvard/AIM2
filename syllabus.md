## A bit about the course
You’ve likely encountered artificial intelligence (AI) before, either through your previous work in computer science, machine learning, or applications of AI in healthcare. You may have developed models, processed data, or explored how AI can transform research and medical practice. In this course, we’ll build on that foundation, but we’ll also challenge you to think differently about the role AI plays in the medical field.

Together, we’ll explore not just how AI models are developed, but why they matter in a real-world healthcare context. For instance, how can self-supervised learning or generative models enhance the way we analyze medical images or understand patient records? How do these techniques integrate into clinical workflows, and what are the implications of their use on patient outcomes and ethical decision-making in healthcare?

We’ll also dive deeply into the process of understanding data—how it’s collected, analyzed, and used in practice. You’ll work hands-on with multimodal data, ranging from natural language to medical imaging, and will develop the skills needed to interpret these data sources effectively, keeping in mind the ethical complexities of AI in healthcare.

Throughout the course, you’ll have opportunities to apply what you learn. You will collaborate on research projects, dive into the current literature, and work on practical tutorials that simulate real-world AI applications in medicine. We’ll be thinking about questions like: What makes an AI model interpretable for clinicians? How do we ensure that AI integrates smoothly into medical practice without disrupting care? And how can we be responsible stewards of AI technology in an ethically complex field like medicine?

By the end of this course, you’ll have sharpened your technical skills and deepened your understanding of the challenges and possibilities AI presents in medicine. You’ll not only know how to build and evaluate AI models but also how to think critically about their application in healthcare settings. The skills you gain will be invaluable in contributing to the future of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

We’re committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and supportive environment that encourages curiosity rather than competition. This responsibility lies with both the course staff and students, who are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.

### Community Standards
{:.no_toc}

In a diverse classroom, it’s important to be mindful of how our actions and words affect others. Remember, diversity has many facets, some of which may not be visible—your classmates may be managing personal, medical, or family challenges that aren’t immediately apparent. Let’s be sensitive to this diversity and avoid comments that may unintentionally discourage others, such as remarks about assignments being "easy" or "crazy." Professionalism is about supporting each other, recognizing that everyone brings unique experiences to the learning environment.

### Respect and Professionalism
{:.no_toc}

Respect and inclusivity apply to interactions between students and course staff as well. Our team is dedicated to treating you with respect, recognizing the diversity of perspectives that enrich our classroom. However, if you ever feel that classroom dynamics or actions by the staff impact your learning environment, please feel free to share your concerns. We welcome your feedback and aim to create a positive and supportive atmosphere for all.

### Title IX and Harassment
{:.no_toc}

Beyond unintentional slips, certain behaviors are not tolerated in this course. Harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment, is prohibited under Title IX federal laws and university policy. If you experience or observe any form of harassment, please reach out to course staff, Title IX coordinators, or university resources as needed. We’re committed to ensuring a safe and respectful learning environment for all students.

## Attendace, Auditing, and Office Hours

Attendance is essential for making the most of this class. Students should plan to attend all sessions unless they have prior permission from the instructor. Missing classes without notice can impact your overall experience and understanding of the course material. This year, our course will meet in person, with live event details available in the Weekly Schedule and key updates on the Home Page.

Auditing is permitted with instructor approval, but it’s important that auditors not increase the workload for instructors or TAs or limit resources for enrolled students. Auditors who would like to participate more actively, such as engaging in class discussions or accessing course resources, should consider enrolling as a “special student” for per-credit access.

Office hours are an open invitation to discuss course material and ask questions. Both virtual and in-person office hours are listed on the Weekly Schedule, with the instructor’s hours included. In-person hours will be held in designated locations.

If you feel a grade does not reflect the criteria fairly, you’re welcome to submit a regrade request. We review regrades in cases of grading errors or rubric misapplication. Requests will not be accepted for incorrect or outdated files unless staff were notified before the deadline.

## Course Policies 

### Academic Integrity
{:.no_toc}

Honesty in your work is essential in this course. Academic integrity means that everything you submit should reflect your own understanding, unless otherwise specified. This includes distinguishing your original ideas from those of others, whether from readings, discussions, or AI tools. While collaboration is welcomed, your submissions should reflect your individual perspective rather than direct copies of others’ work. Sharing completed work, unless explicitly allowed, goes against our guidelines. If you’re ever uncertain about these policies, please reach out—there’s no penalty for asking, and I’m here to help clarify.

### Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI
{:.no_toc}

Students may use LLMs or generative AI tools responsibly for ideation or assistance with complex concepts, provided their use is fully acknowledged. Your submissions should indicate how and to what extent these tools assisted you. Remember, you are responsible for the accuracy and originality of your work; using AI to shortcut the learning process or fabricate data is prohibited. AI should be a support tool, not a replacement for your analysis and critical thinking.

### Collaboration and Academic Dishonesty
{:.no_toc}

Collaboration in this course means working together to understand concepts—not sharing completed work or solutions. You are encouraged to discuss ideas and challenges with classmates, but submitted work should be yours alone. Sharing solutions, copying code directly from other sources, or submitting work that does not reflect your understanding violates our standards. Always clearly cite sources and distinguish your contributions from those of others. If you’re unsure about what constitutes acceptable collaboration, please ask.

### Community Standards
{:.no_toc}

Our classroom is a place where diverse perspectives are valued. Maintaining an inclusive, respectful, and open environment is a shared responsibility of both students and instructors. We each bring unique experiences and backgrounds that shape our understanding. Please be mindful of how your actions, words, and even seemingly small comments can impact others. If you ever feel that bias or a lack of inclusivity is affecting your experience, please connect with me. Additional resources such as the Office for Gender Equity and the Ombuds Office are also available to provide support. Harvard Medical School is committed to an inclusive learning environment, and we encourage you to reach out if you encounter barriers.

### Reasonable Accommodations
{:.no_toc}

Harvard Medical School is dedicated to supporting students with documented disabilities. If you need accommodations, please connect with the Disability Access Office or HMS Director of Disability Services, ideally at least two weeks before accommodations are needed. This process ensures privacy, with only relevant parties informed. Feel free to discuss your needs with me directly as well, and we’ll work together to ensure you have the support necessary to succeed.

### Late Policy
{:.no_toc}

Extensions are only granted in exceptional cases. If you need additional time, please contact me as early as possible to request an extension. Requests close to the deadline may not receive a response in time. Simply submitting a request does not guarantee an extension. If you’re unable to complete your work fully, it’s better to submit what you have by the deadline to receive credit for your efforts.

### Regrade Requests
{:.no_toc}

Regrade requests are available if there’s a concern that the grading rubric was applied incorrectly or if an error was made in the grading process. Requests will not be accepted if incorrect files were submitted without notifying staff before the deadline or if an outdated file was uploaded by mistake. Please be proactive in checking submissions to avoid these situations.
